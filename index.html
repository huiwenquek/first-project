    <p> About Squidward Tentacles</p>
    <p><b>Squidward Q. Tentacles is a fictional character voiced by actor Rodger Bumpass in the Nickelodeon animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants. Squidward was created and designed by marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg. He first appeared on television in the series' pilot episode "Help Wanted" on May 1, 1999.

      Although his name has the word "squid" in it, Squidward is an anthropomorphic octopus.[a] He lives in a moai between SpongeBob SquarePants' and Patrick Star's houses. The character is portrayed as ill-tempered, lazy, selfish, and pretentious, and he despises his two neighbors' constant noisy behavior. However, the pair are unaware of Squidward's antipathy towards them and see him as a friend. Squidward works as a cashier at the Krusty Krab restaurant, a job which he dislikes.

      The character's reception from fans has been positive. Squidward has appeared in many SpongeBob SquarePants publications, toys, and other merchandise. He appears in the 2004 full-length feature film The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie and its sequel, which was released in 2015.</b></p>
